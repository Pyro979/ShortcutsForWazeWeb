        <h2 id="privacy-policy">Privacy Policy for Shortcuts for Waze</h2>

        <h3 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            Shortcuts for Waze ("we", "our", or "us") is an Android app that helps you create navigation shortcuts for the Waze navigation app.
            We respect your privacy and aim to be clear about what data the app handles, how it is used, and what control you have.
        </p>
        <p>
            Shortcuts for Waze stores your information <strong>locally on your device</strong>. We do not operate any backend servers for this app, and we do not store your personal data on our own infrastructure.
        </p>
        <p>
            By using Shortcuts for Waze, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.
        </p>

        <h3 id="data-collection">2. Information We Collect and Store</h3>

        <p><strong>2.1 Information Stored Locally on Your Device</strong></p>
        <p>The following information is stored only on your device as part of normal app functionality:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Shortcut labels and destination addresses/coordinates</li>
            <li>Selected custom icons for shortcuts</li>
            <li>App preferences and settings</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can delete this data at any time by uninstalling the app.</p>

        <p><strong>2.2 Location Information</strong></p>
        <p>
            The app requests location permissions to enable features such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Using your current location as a navigation destination</li>
            <li>Improving address autocomplete accuracy</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Location data is only accessed when you explicitly use these features. We do not continuously track your location.
            Location data is processed locally on your device and is not transmitted to our servers (we have none).
        </p>

        <p><strong>2.3 Information We Do Not Collect</strong></p>
        <p>We do <strong>not</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Collect or transmit your shortcut data to our servers (we have none)</li>
            <li>Collect or store your navigation history on our servers</li>
            <li>Access your contacts</li>
            <li>Track your behavior or usage across apps or websites</li>
            <li>Use advertising identifiers or analytics services (no Google Analytics, no ad SDKs)</li>
            <li>Sell or share your personal information for advertising purposes</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>2.4 Crash Reporting (Sentry)</strong></p>
        <p>
            We use <strong>Sentry</strong> to collect crash reports and diagnostic information to help us improve the app.
            Sentry may collect technical data such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Device model and operating system version</li>
            <li>App version</li>
            <li>Error messages and stack traces</li>
            <li>Non-resettable device identifiers used only for debugging</li>
            <li>Approximate time and context of the crash</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Sentry <strong>does not</strong> receive your shortcut labels, addresses, coordinates, or any navigation data you create with the app.
        </p>
        <p>
            For more information about how Sentry handles data, see:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sentry Privacy Policy: <a href="https://sentry.io/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://sentry.io/privacy/</a></li>
            <li>Sentry Data Processing Addendum: <a href="https://sentry.io/legal/dpa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://sentry.io/legal/dpa/</a></li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>2.5 Google Places API</strong></p>
        <p>
            We use <strong>Google Places API</strong> to provide address autocomplete functionality when you search for locations.
            When you use this feature:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your search queries are sent to Google to provide address suggestions</li>
            <li>Google processes this data in accordance with Google's Privacy Policy</li>
            <li>We do not store or log your search queries on our servers (we have none)</li>
            <li>Selected addresses are stored locally on your device only</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Your use of Google Places API is subject to Google's policies, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Google Privacy Policy: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></li>
            <li>Google Terms of Service: <a href="https://policies.google.com/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://policies.google.com/terms</a></li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>2.6 Google Play Data Safety Summary</strong></p>
        <p>
            To align with the Google Play Data Safety form, here is a plain-language summary of what is sent off your device and why:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data we do not collect:</strong> We do not collect your name, email address, phone number, contacts, payment information, or your navigation history. Your shortcuts, labels, and destination addresses/coordinates remain on your device.</li>
            <li><strong>Crash logs and diagnostics:</strong> Technical crash and diagnostic data (device model, OS version, app version, error stack traces, and debugging identifiers) are sent to Sentry for the sole purpose of fixing bugs and improving app stability. This data is not used for advertising or marketing.</li>
            <li><strong>Search queries for address autocomplete:</strong> When you use address autocomplete, your query is sent directly to Google Places API to return suggestions. This is handled under Google's own Privacy Policy. We do not store these queries on our own servers.</li>
            <li><strong>Device or other IDs:</strong> Sentry may use non-resettable device identifiers as part of crash and diagnostic reporting. These are used only for debugging and stability analytics, not for cross-app tracking or ads.</li>
            <li><strong>No advertising or marketing use:</strong> We do not use the collected crash/diagnostic data for targeted advertising, user profiling, or selling data to third parties.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The answers you provide in the Google Play Console Data Safety section should reflect this: the app sends crash/diagnostic data to Sentry and search queries to Google Places, but does not collect personal identifiers like names or addresses for its own servers, and does not use data for advertising.
        </p>

        <h3 id="data-use">3. How We Use Your Data</h3>
        <p>We use the collected data for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To provide and maintain the app's functionality</li>
            <li>To improve app performance and user experience</li>
            <li>To diagnose and fix technical issues (via Sentry crash reporting)</li>
            <li>To understand, at a technical level, how the app behaves so we can improve stability</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="data-sharing">4. Data Sharing</h3>
        <p>
            We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties. We may share data with:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google Services:</strong> We use Google Places API for address autocomplete. When you use this feature, your search queries are sent to Google in accordance with Google's Privacy Policy. We do not store or log your search queries on our servers.</li>
            <li><strong>Sentry:</strong> Crash reports and diagnostic information are sent to Sentry to help us identify and fix issues. Sentry does not receive your shortcut data, addresses, or any personal navigation information.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>Important:</strong> We do not operate any backend servers. All data sharing occurs only through these third-party services as described above.
        </p>

        <h3 id="data-security">5. Data Security</h3>
        <p>
            We implement appropriate security measures to protect your information. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your shortcut data, addresses, and coordinates are stored locally on your device and are not transmitted to our servers (we have none).
            Data is only transmitted to third-party services (Google Places API and Sentry) as described in Section 4.
        </p>

        <h3 id="your-rights">6. Your Rights</h3>
        <p><strong>6.1 Access</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>You can view all your shortcuts and settings directly in the app.</li>
            <li>All data is stored locally on your device.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>6.2 Deletion</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>You can delete individual shortcuts from your device's home screen.</li>
            <li>Uninstalling the app removes all local data stored by Shortcuts for Waze.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>6.3 Control</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>You can revoke location permissions at any time via your device settings.</li>
            <li>You can choose not to use address autocomplete if you prefer to enter addresses manually.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>6.4 Requests Under GDPR or Similar Laws</strong></p>
        <p>
            Because we do not store your personal data on our servers, most requests (access, correction, deletion) can be fulfilled directly by using the app or uninstalling it.
            If you have questions or need assistance, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:app+s4w@uxiomatic.com">app+s4w@uxiomatic.com</a>, and we will respond within the time frames required by applicable law (typically within 30 days).
        </p>

        <h3 id="children">7. Children's Privacy</h3>
        <p>
            Shortcuts for Waze is not intended for children under 13 years of age.
            We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
            Because we do not run any servers, we do not maintain server-side records about users of any age.
        </p>

        <h3 id="changes">8. Changes to This Policy</h3>
        <p>
            We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.
            When we do, we will update the "Last Updated" date and version number at the top of this page.
