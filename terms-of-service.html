        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Server Infrastructure:</strong> We do not operate any backend servers for this app. All data is stored locally on your device, and third-party services (Google Places API, Sentry) are used only as necessary for app functionality and crash reporting.
        </p>

            <li>Use the App in any way that violates any applicable law or regulation</li>
            <li>Use the App to create shortcuts to illegal or harmful locations</li>
            <li>Attempt to reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the App</li>
            <li>Remove or alter any copyright, trademark, or other proprietary notices</li>

        <h3 id="waze-integration">Waze Integration</h3>
        <p>
            This App integrates with Waze by creating shortcuts that launch Waze with specific destinations. The App requires Waze to be installed on your device to function properly.
        </p>

        </ul>

        <h3 id="location-services">Location Services</h3>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>
            You can revoke location permissions at any time through your device settings, though this may limit certain App features.
        </p>
