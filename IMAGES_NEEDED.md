# Images Needed

The following images need to be added to complete the website:

## Required Images

1. **logo.png** (96x96px recommended)
   - App logo/icon
   - Should match the app's launcher icon
   - Place in root directory: `docs/web/logo.png`

2. **favicon.png** (32x32px or 64x64px)
   - Browser tab icon
   - Place in root directory: `docs/web/favicon.png`

3. **assets/theme_mockup.png** (320px width recommended)
   - App screenshot/mockup for the main page
   - Should showcase the app's interface
   - Place in: `docs/web/assets/theme_mockup.png`

## Notes

- All images should be optimized for web (PNG or JPEG)
- The logo and favicon can be extracted from the app's resources
- The screenshot can be taken from the app or created as a mockup
- Once screenshots are ready (per migration plan requirements), you can replace the mockup with actual screenshots
